### About the Data
The following  Data set containing values for six biomechanical features used to classify orthopaedic patients into 3 classes (normal, disk hernia or spondilolysthesis). http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/vertebral+column

Each patient is represented in the data set by six biomechanical attributes derived from the shape and orientation of the pelvis and lumbar spine (in this order): pelvic incidence, pelvic tilt, lumbar lordosis angle, sacral slope, pelvic radius and grade of spondylolisthesis. The following convention is used for the class labels: DH (Disk Hernia), Spondylolisthesis (SL), Normal (NO) and Abnormal (AB).
